# Auto FortTimeMachine
 An AHK script to automatically do the steps required to run FortTimeMachine
 
 I am not in any way shape or form affiliated with FortTimeMachine, IGCSInjector, or UniversalUE4Unlocker. These files are just needed for the AHK file to work.
 You can edit the AHK script in any way you want, it's not that hard to make.
 
 Explaining the DLLs and bat files:
 Injector.bat is just to run IGCS automatically, you can verify this by editing it.
 ftm2.dll is FortTimeMachine, I just renamed it.
