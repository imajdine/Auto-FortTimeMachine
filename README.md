# Auto FortTimeMachine
 An AHK script to automatically do the steps required to run FortTimeMachine
 
Injector.bat is used to automatically inject FortTimeMachine since I couldn't find a way to make IGCSInjector do it automatically.

The Dlls in the UUU folder are required by UUU, I did not make them.

 I am not in any way shape or form affiliated with FortTimeMachine, IGCSInjector, or UniversalUE4Unlocker. These files are just needed for the AHK file to work.
 You can edit the AHK script in any way you want, it's not that hard to make.
